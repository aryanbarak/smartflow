# SmartFlow - Project Status

Last updated: 2026-07-22

## 1. Executive Summary

SmartFlow has moved beyond a static productivity dashboard. It is now an AI
Personal Operating System with a deterministic workspace pipeline, explicit
agent safety boundaries, read-only execution, one approved write vertical slice,
reflection, context synthesis, and deterministic response composition.

The current system remains intentionally bounded. It does not perform
autonomous execution, does not run hidden tool chains, does not let the LLM
approve or execute actions, and does not expose internal policy, audit, memory,
or engine metadata to users.

Current focus: production-readiness review of the proposal boundary after
completing both controlled browser integration and local real-worker reasoning
validation, plus registration-gated validation of the first GitHub App
read-only integration. Production deployment itself has not been validated.

---

## 2. Current Project Phase

Current phase: deterministic AI Personal Operating System foundation complete;
safe agent response and execution infrastructure in validation.

Engineering posture:

- deterministic validation remains authoritative,
- LLM output is proposal-only,
- planning never executes,
- approval is not execution,
- explicit user action is required before runtime execution,
- read-only execution remains the default safe path,
- `tasks.complete` is the only enabled write tool,
- runtime results are authoritative during response synthesis,
- Dashboard remains presentation-focused.

## 4. Living Workspace Architecture

The Living Workspace is generated through `src/features/workspace/`.

Current deterministic Workspace pipeline:

```text
useWorkspace()
-> signalEngine()
-> memoryEngine()
-> interactionFeedbackEngine()
-> decisionIntelligenceEngine()
-> personalizationEngine()
-> priorityEngine()
-> goalEngine()
-> plannerEngine()
-> approvalEngine()
-> workspaceEngine()
-> Dashboard
```

Execution Audit remains outside the workspace generation pipeline. It observes
actual execution only.

Decision Intelligence V1 is deterministic, input-only, and read-only. It uses
validated reflection evidence and bounded interaction feedback to produce a
domain-level decision profile. It weakly influences medium/low ordering only,
never overrides urgent signals or onboarding, does not mutate memory, and does
not execute or initiate autonomous behavior.

The Dashboard is primarily a presentation surface for a typed Workspace object.
Workspace decision-making belongs in the workspace engines, not in
`Dashboard.tsx`.

---

## 5. Agent Reasoning and Execution Architecture

Current agent reasoning and execution pipeline:

```text
User Message
-> AI Response Language Resolution
-> LLM Reasoning Layer
-> Structured Intent Proposal
-> Deterministic Intent Validator
-> Tool Resolver
-> Approval Model / Approval Interaction
-> explicit user action
-> Read-only Runtime or Write Runtime
-> Execution Policy
-> Execution Engine / explicit handler
-> Execution Audit
-> Reflection Engine
-> Reflection Integration
-> safe Memory Evidence
-> Context Synthesis
-> Response Composer
-> Chat UI
```

The LLM Reasoning Layer supports these intents:

- `inspect_tasks`
- `inspect_calendar`
- `inspect_learning`
- `inspect_workspace`
- `inspect_github_repositories`
- `complete_task`
- `ask_clarification`
- `unsupported`

Intent-to-tool mappings:

- `inspect_tasks` -> `tasks.list`
- `inspect_calendar` -> `calendar.list_today`
- `inspect_learning` -> `learning.get_progress`
- `inspect_workspace` -> `workspace.get_context`
- `inspect_github_repositories` -> `github.repositories.list`
- `complete_task` -> `tasks.complete`

Security boundary:

- the LLM proposes only,
- deterministic validation always runs,
- the LLM cannot execute,
- the LLM cannot approve,
- the LLM cannot supply authenticated user identity,
- the LLM cannot invent arbitrary executable tools,
- unsupported and mixed requests fail closed,
- ambiguous task targets require clarification,
- read and write actions still require explicit user interaction.

Multilingual domain correction is bounded. Task markers override generic
`today` / `heute` / `امروز` markers. Strong task, calendar, learning, and
workspace evidence is bounded; conflicting strong evidence asks for
clarification. This is not a general semantic classifier.

---

## 6. Execution Capabilities

Supported read-only executable tools:

- `tasks.list`
- `calendar.list_today`
- `learning.get_progress`
- `workspace.get_context`
- `github.repositories.list` (implemented and mocked locally; real GitHub App QA pending)

Supported write executable tools:

- `tasks.complete` only

Write execution guarantees for `tasks.complete`:

- exact step, tool, and target approval binding is required,
- approval and execution are separate user actions,
- authenticated user identity is injected by the runtime,
- task completion is state-idempotent,
- post-write verification is required,
- no automatic retry,
- no chained execution,
- no autonomous execution,
- no other write tool is enabled.

Execution handlers are explicit. They remain framework-independent and must not
import React hooks, UI components, route components, Supabase clients in UI
surfaces, or LLM logic.

---

## 7. AI Language and Response Composition

SmartFlow separates interface language from AI response language.

Supported AI response language values:

- `auto`
- `en`
- `de`
- `fa`

Resolution rules:

- fixed response language wins,
- `auto` follows the latest user message,
- unclear detection falls back safely,
- response RTL/LTR applies to AI response content only,
- interface direction remains independent.

TasksPage AI and Flow AI Chat have been browser-validated in English, German,
and Persian.

Response Composer V1 is a deterministic presentation layer that runs after
verified runtime and reflection output. It supports the six current tools,
creates a headline, summary, bounded details, and optional safe suggestion. It
does not call another LLM, does not inspect raw handler payloads, does not alter
runtime results, does not expose policy/audit/request IDs/raw JSON/internal
metadata, and preserves the resolved response language.

Context Synthesis V1 composes bounded meaning before final response rendering:

```text
Verified Runtime Result
+ bounded Workspace snapshot
+ safe Reflection summary
+ bounded Decision profile
-> Context Synthesis
-> Response Composer
-> Chat UI
```

Supported synthesis domains:

- tasks
- calendar
- learning
- workspace
- github

`tasks.complete` receives only verified safe response facts and currently no
broad cross-context synthesis.

Context synthesis safeguards:

- runtime result is authoritative,
- contradictions suppress synthesis rather than guessing,
- supporting facts are bounded,
- suggestions are optional and non-executing,
- no personality, emotional, mastery, motivation, importance, or future-action
  inference,
- Decision Intelligence may only produce neutral continuity wording under
  sufficient evidence,
- no raw memory, audit, policy, prompt, private note, document body, user ID, or
  Supabase structure is consumed or exposed.

## 8. Validated User-Visible Flows

Validated read-only flow:

```text
Natural-language request
-> interpreted intent card
-> explicit Run
-> verified result
-> reflection
-> optional local memory evidence
-> synthesized and composed natural response
```

Validated write flow:

```text
Exact task-completion request
-> resolved exact task
-> Review
-> Approve
-> no execution yet
-> separate Complete Task action
-> policy
-> idempotent mutation
-> persisted-state verification
-> audit
-> reflection
-> safe response
-> task refresh
```

Guarantees:

- no action runs on render,
- no action runs on approval alone,
- no hidden approve-and-run path exists,
- ambiguous targets are never guessed.

Latest confirmed validation:

- Agent tests: 262 passed
- GitHub Worker tests: 24 passed
- GitHub migration/type-structure tests: 4 passed
- GitHub frontend client/UI tests: 19 passed
- GitHub focused suite: 47 passed
- GitHub live local Supabase RLS/lifecycle tests: 5 passed
- Workspace tests: 75 passed
- ChatPage tests: 14 passed
- Full default test suite: 474 passed; 5 gated live-RLS tests skipped by default
- TypeScript: passed
- Worker TypeScript: passed
- Production build: passed

Existing non-failing build warnings:

- large chunk warning
- empty `vendor-pdfjs` chunk warning

Live browser validation completed before the current ARUX matrix:

- TasksPage answers correctly in Persian, German, and English,
- Flow AI correctly resolves baseline task requests in Persian, German, and
  English,
- calendar distinction remains correct,
- explicit execution remains required,
- no false English-only capability response remains.

Current Agent Response UX Validation V1 status:

- deterministic response and intent tests pass,
- bounded authentication smoke passes against local Supabase,
- canonical ARUX evidence exists at
  `docs/testing/evidence/agent-response-ux-validation-v1.json`,
- Controlled Authenticated Browser Integration: `PASS` (15/15 rows),
- ARUX-11 verifies the already-complete task as an idempotent no-op without a
  duplicate mutation,
- ARUX-13 and ARUX-15 preserve Persian RTL flow while isolated Latin content
  computes as LTR,
- ARUX-14 keeps proposal, composed answer, and runtime summary in German,
- the controlled matrix used intercepted deterministic proposals,
- deterministic browser stubs are not treated as proof of real LLM intent
  recognition, worker transport, or real multilingual reasoning behavior,
- the separate local real-worker matrix is `PASS` (8/8), with canonical evidence
  at `docs/testing/evidence/real-worker-arux-matrix-v1.json`,
- every accepted real-worker row used one real Gemini request through local
  `/agent/reason`, local Supabase Auth, deterministic validation, and resolver
  output,
- the real-worker matrix granted no approval, executed no tool, persisted no
  reasoning request, and contacted no production service,
- neither matrix is production deployment validation.

## 9. Technical Debt

- `tasks.complete` is the only write slice; additional write tools require
  separate safety review.
- Conversation memory is not yet implemented.
- Semantic memory, vector memory, and RAG are not active.
- Right-rail learning/recommendation content still includes static placeholders.
- Some interaction events are only captured where the UI genuinely exposes them.
- Learn AI and chat-related storage still need pruning policies.
- Error tracking is not centralized.
- Supabase generated types now include the GitHub connection tables; future
  schema changes must continue using the canonical generation workflow.
- Some older UI strings still need i18n/RTL polish.
- Production build still reports large Vite chunks.
- GitHub Read-only Integration V1 Slice 1 has passed clean local migration
  replay, canonical type refresh, two-user RLS/lifecycle tests, and a local
  authenticated Worker lifecycle smoke. A pre-registration hardening pass found
  and fixed three concrete blockers that the validations above depend on: the
  migration did not grant `service_role` any privilege on either new table
  (the Worker's own connection-lifecycle writes would have failed against a
  real database), the committed `types.ts` was a stale, hand-patched snapshot
  missing dozens of real tables predating this Slice, and five TypeScript
  regressions surfaced once the correct types were restored (a
  `WorkspaceSignalDomain`/`WorkspacePlanDomain` mismatch in two agent files, an
  unnarrowed `GitHubConnectionStatus` access, and two test-mock typing gaps).
  All are now fixed and independently re-verified. Manual GitHub App
  registration, authenticated real-provider QA, and a live-Chrome ARUX-style
  browser QA pass (as opposed to the authenticated component/unit-test
  evidence gathered so far) remain required before completion.

---

## 10. Next Sprint

Current next milestones: production proposal-boundary readiness review and the
manual registration/real-provider QA gate for GitHub Read-only Integration V1
Slice 1.

Recommended selection criteria:

- preserve explicit approval and execution boundaries,
- do not expand write tools without a separate safety review,
- keep runtime facts authoritative in final responses,
- keep browser QA mandatory for user-visible agent behavior,
- disclose proposal source and worker transport in every evidence row.
- retain fail-closed local/production configuration separation before any
  deployment validation.

---

## 11. Long-Term Roadmap

Possible future milestones, not implemented:

- manual multi-step plan execution
- conversation memory
- semantic memory
- vector/RAG memory
- additional approved write tools
- calendar write
- task creation
- document/email agent capabilities
- autonomous execution
- live AI-generated recommendations
- real multi-session conversation memory
