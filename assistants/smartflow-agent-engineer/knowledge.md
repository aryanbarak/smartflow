Future sources, not currently listed as upload-ready: dedicated Agent Pipeline docs, execution architecture docs, tool contract docs and implementation test strategy docs as they are added.

## Excluded Knowledge

- `.knowledge/`
- `.prompts/`
- `.env`
- generated output such as `dist/`, `coverage/` and `.knowledge/context_output.md`
- dependency folders such as `node_modules/`
- lockfiles
- general visual design documents unless they define an execution contract

## Upload Notes

Upload only the listed canonical files. Do not copy project documentation or source code into `assistants/`. Re-upload Knowledge manually after material changes to agent contracts, execution policy, tool registry, approval, audit or project status.
