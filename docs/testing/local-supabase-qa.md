# Local Supabase QA

This workflow exists only for authenticated browser QA against a local Supabase stack. It must not be used against the production Supabase project.

## Start Local Supabase

```bash
supabase start
```

Use only the local URLs printed by the CLI, normally `http://127.0.0.1:54321`.

## Run The App Against Local Supabase

Set browser-safe Vite values before starting the dev server:

```bash
VITE_SMARTFLOW_SUPABASE_MODE=local-qa
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<local anon key from supabase start>
npm run dev
```

Production remains the default when `VITE_SMARTFLOW_SUPABASE_MODE` is not set. Local QA mode fails closed if the URL is not loopback or if the anon key is missing.

## Seed A Named Scenario

The seed script requires local-only server-side values from the shell. Do not put service-role keys in tracked files.

```bash
SUPABASE_LOCAL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
SUPABASE_LOCAL_ANON_KEY=<local anon key>
SUPABASE_LOCAL_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<local service role key>
SMARTFLOW_LOCAL_QA_PASSWORD=<local password>
npm run qa:seed -- --scenario workspace-rich --verify-rls
```

Supported scenarios:

- `empty`
- `tasks-basic`
- `workspace-rich`

`empty` means empty for the authenticated browser-QA state that can affect ARUX validation:
chat sessions/messages, agent briefings, learning messages, calendar events, finance transactions,
documents metadata, tasks, profile, and user settings. It is not a global wipe of every SmartFlow
feature domain.

The script derives date-sensitive fixtures from the current local date at runtime, including today, tomorrow, current-day calendar events, and completed-this-week task data.

Reset and fixture writes fail closed. If any ARUX-relevant table cannot be reset, verified empty, or seeded, the script stops with a non-zero exit code and must not be treated as a valid QA state.

## Local QA Login

Default email:

```text
smartflow-local-qa@example.com
```

Use the password supplied through `SMARTFLOW_LOCAL_QA_PASSWORD`.

## Safety Guards

- The seed script refuses non-loopback Supabase URLs.
- Local URLs must be plain loopback `http` origins without username, password, path, query, or hash.
- The browser never receives a service-role key.
- The app never silently falls back from local QA mode to production.
- The script resets only the isolated local QA user data for the ARUX-relevant tables listed above.
- `--verify-rls` confirms another local user cannot read the seeded user's task rows.

## Migration History Warning

The local compatibility migrations reconstruct schema that was previously manual or missing from clean local replay. Their historical ordering is required for a fresh local Supabase stack because later migrations depend on those tables/functions.

Do not blindly push, repair, or reset a remote production database with these files. Production migration history must be audited and reconciled separately before any remote migration operation.

## Stop Local Supabase

```bash
supabase stop
```
